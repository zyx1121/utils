# utils

Agent-first CLI toolbox. Hooks watch the throwaway scripts your agent writes, propose new ones when patterns repeat. Each command is a self-contained executable — Python (PEP 723), bash, AppleScript, whatever — runtime declared via shebang. The plugin ships everything; no Poetry, no PyPI, no package management.

## Install

```
/plugin marketplace add zyx1121/marketplace
/plugin install utils@zyx1121
```

Prerequisite: [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) on PATH. After install, the hook starts logging to `~/.claude/data/utils/observations.jsonl`.

## What's inside

A `utils` dispatcher (`bin/utils`) is installed onto PATH automatically by the plugin. Use it like a regular CLI:

```bash
utils --help              # list available commands

# basics
utils uuid --count 3
utils hash README.md --algo sha256
utils ssl-check github.com
utils tokens prompt.txt --model opus

# macOS atoms
echo "hi" | utils clipboard write
utils screenshot                            # → /tmp/screenshot.png
utils notify "build done" --sound Glass
utils reminders add "ping 建超 tomorrow"
utils calendar list                          # this week
utils mail search "ICCCAS"
utils keynote open ~/Desktop/deck.key
utils safari url                            # frontmost tab URL
```

Under the hood, each command is a self-contained executable. Most are PEP 723 Python:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.11"
# dependencies = ["typer", "rich", "..."]
# ///
"""<purpose>"""
import typer
def main(...): ...
if __name__ == "__main__":
    typer.run(main)
```

Bash or AppleScript also work — anything with a shebang and exec bit. The dispatcher just looks up `scripts/<cmd>` or `scripts/<cmd>.<ext>` and `exec`s the first match; shebang does the rest. First Python invocation downloads declared deps to uv's cache; later runs are near-instant. No `pip install` step ever.

The README doesn't enumerate commands — that list grows. `utils --list` is authoritative.

## Output contract

Scripts emit a JSON envelope on stdout when piped or redirected, and a human-friendly view when stdout is a terminal — toggle is automatic, no `--json` flag.

```bash
$ utils ssl-check github.com | jq -r .data.days_remaining
79
```

The envelope shape is fixed:

```jsonc
// success
{"success": true,  "data": <value>, "metadata": {...}}
// failure (exit code non-zero)
{"success": false, "error": {"message": "...", "why": "...", "hint": "..."}}
```

`data` is whatever the command produced; `metadata` carries provenance bits an agent might branch on (source path, format flag, etc). On failure, `error` gives three fields — `message` for what broke, `why` for the underlying cause, `hint` for what to try next. Errors are documentation: agents read them before they read `--help`.

Shared helpers live in [`lib/_envelope.py`](lib/_envelope.py) — `emit`, `fail`, `parse_host`. Every Python script imports them; see [`scripts/ssl-check.py`](scripts/ssl-check.py) for the canonical shape and [`agents/utils-promoter.md`](agents/utils-promoter.md) for the import shim new scripts must use.

## Per-command setup

A few commands need a one-time macOS-side tweak before they work:

- **`safari js` / `safari selection`** — these eval JavaScript in the frontmost Safari tab. Apple gates this behind:
  1. Safari → Settings → Advanced → ✅ *Show Develop menu in menu bar*
  2. Develop menu → ✅ *Allow JavaScript from Apple Events*

  Plain `safari url` / `title` / `text` / `tabs` / `open` / `close` work out of the box without this. The `text` op alone covers most "extract page content" agent flows — JS is only needed when you want the current selection or arbitrary DOM queries.

## Lifecycle

```
[agent writes throwaway script]
            │
            ▼
   PostToolUse hook (cheap, no LLM)
            │
            ▼
~/.claude/data/utils/observations.jsonl
            │
            ▼
   /utils:review (you, on demand)
            │   cluster repeats
            │   flag failing scripts
            ▼
  approve candidate → utils-promoter agent
            │
            ▼
       PR to this repo
            │
            ▼
       merge → next session has it
```

Three layers, kept separate so the cheap thing stays cheap:

- **Observe** (hook) — pure logging. No LLM, no network, ~1ms per event. Filters noise (`ls`, `cat`, `git`, …), records ad-hoc script writes / runs and invocations of this plugin's own scripts.
- **Analyze** (`/utils:review` skill) — read the log, cluster semantically, present candidates as a table. You decide which to promote.
- **Promote** (`utils-promoter` agent) — write the new script, open a PR. You merge.

No auto-rotation yet. Trim by hand if it ever gets big.

## Why this design

An earlier version was a Poetry-managed PyPI package with a global `utils` CLI. That fit human use — `pip install zyx-utils` once, type `utils foo` in any terminal. But the real consumer is the agent, and PyPI carried: build pipeline, version management, sync-across-devices ceremony, release tagging, signing. All overhead for someone who doesn't need a global binary.

So: plugin ships scripts directly. Agent runs them via `uv run`. New device gets everything from `claude plugin install`. No `pip` step, no version mismatch, no PyPI release dance, no Poetry.
